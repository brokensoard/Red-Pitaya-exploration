# Red-Pitaya-exploration
Experiments with the red Pitaya FPGA

This repository will contain ongoing experiments with the Red Pitaya 122.88-16 SDR FPA development board. I'll document the board and the development process using Vivado. As a beginner in FPGA Development, I hope that some of this work will be useful as others learn to develop on the platform.
